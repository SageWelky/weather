# Project: Weather App

[Live Preview](https://sagewelky.github.io/weather/)

## Description:

### Overview:

Simple weather app that retrieves weather information from an API and displays it for the user.

### Features:

*Pulls weather information from an API.
*Matches weather information to appropriate icons.
*Displays information alongside the matching icon in tiles.


## Personal Goals for the Project:

### Initial:

I plan to refine my use of single-responsibility principle and better and improve my project organization with lessons learned from the Todo app. Further, I plan to extract more of the reused code into helper functions early on through better envisioning how the state changes will look during the planning phase. Lastly, I intend to get practice using APIs through the parsing of the information returned from the API calls used to get weather data.

### Reflection:

I definitely improved project organization and my use of SOLID principles, and using APIs was pretty simple in this project, just as it has been in prior experience working in the .NET stack. The most unexpected element was how long it took to run through different aesthetic options trying to find something that felt original and interesting. In the end, I cut a lot of the things I was experimenting with due to time, and went with a very simple layout and colour combination. In hindsight I wish I would have spent the time simply adding more features. I might spend some time purely dedicated to studying how more senior developers make aesthetically pleasing designs quickly, and learn from their process.

## What I'd Want To Do Returning To This Project:

I would want to come back with a clear design language in mind, and add a more complete set of features such as weekly forecast, and the ability to see a breakdown the day's conditions by hour. I don't think it would be very difficult to accomplish, or to reach the level of quaility that other apps on the market have. Most of the heavy lifting is done by the API, so much of the rest of the app's quality would come down to time-investment. Perhaps I could find a way to leverage some small libraries to make the construction of the app quicker, too, but at the very least I know using a front-end framework like React would expedite the process from prior experience working with it. I look forward to the upcoming React section in my studies, as learning how to use it from a more formalized approach will serve to enhance my abilities with it, making the return to a more modern set of developement tools feel all the more gratifying in compairison. With that in mind, I might want to return to this project with a complete replacement made in React to see how many more features I could add in a comparitive amount of time.
