## Personal Goals for the Project:

### Initial:

I plan to refine my use of single-responsibility principle and better and improve my project organization with lessons learned from the Todo app. Further, I plan to extract more of the reused code into helper functions early on through better envisioning how the state changes will look during the planning phase. Lastly, I intend to get practice using APIs through the parsing of the information returned from the API calls used to get weather data.

### Reflection:
